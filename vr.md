This guide will compare the top 5 best (for the money) headsets by popular sentiment as of Dec 2022. Numbers are rounded up or down for easier understanding while keeping statistical integrity. Buzzwords are turned into keywords that are consistent throughout the guide, so you can cut through all the bullshit marketing. 

**Keywords:**

- **Sweet spot:** Refraction causes blur and god rays towards the edges of the screen. On headsets with sweet spots, the center will be the most clear looking, and when you turn your eyes towards the edges you will see a more and more blurry image. On headsets with bad sweet spots, instead of turning your eyes to look at something nearby, you should turn your head for the best clarity image.
- **Lens type:** Pancake lenses are smaller, lighter and has no light refraction. Therefore pancake lenses eliminate the sweet spot problem completely. Pancake lenses are considered superior to it's older, refraction based lens counterparts. Newer headsets feature pancake lenses.
- **Wireless:** Can play android games without a PC. You can install APKs. All wireless headsets here can use a cable to connect to a PC, however the cable is USB3 instead of HDMI or DP so the data transfer rate is limited. Hence there's a cable compression problem. Obviously, wireless has even worse compression than cable.
- **Screendoor effect:** You can see in between the pixels as they are not clumped up enough.
- **FOV:** Field of view. Headsets have different FOVs for different axis, I put the average in(calculating with average IPD).
- **IPD:** Distance between eyes. Adjustment that is available on all headsets here.
