# My Requirements:

- little to no heat trapping
- i wanna try open back for immersion in games
- comfort is top prio
- a good mic is needed somewhere in the setup, desktop mics pick up keyboard clacking, unless you set up an arm but thats pushing far for now
- prefer wireless a lot, but if I buy open back, I can't use it outside, so wireless is not that important for it. Damn cables will annoy me tho
- mic + headphones budget: $300 (with modmic 220 is left for hp's, with boompro 240 is left for hp's)
- detachable/cleanable earpads is a must

---

# Microphones:

headset wireless mics usually suck

modmic's are way too expensive, as expensive as a headset ($50-120 before tax and shipping)

if ur buying a modmic, just buy the wireless one and be done with it forever, if u have to buy the wired one, buy the usb one

modmic stickies are just double sided tape, no biggie of wearing it out

hc - boompro https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euoVAmgp0Lw&t=429s

I have 2 categories for mic: Good and bad, I'll never use the bad ones, I'm happy to use the good ones. Iff mic is good it gets good mic comment, if its avg or below it gets bad mic comment. Modmic 4 is a good mic, so is boompro, %60 of wired headset mic are bad, %95 of wireless headset mics are bad. If its comfortable to listen to, with decent detail, it's a good mic. That said, my expectations are not low.

  - extremely comfortable, pads look bad but are great
- hc https://youtu.be/CLPa1ejmKXE
- badseed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4hmyUi5K28
  - amp (or was it dac?) helps the low bass and makes these headphones pretty much "perfect"
- techyescity https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FNDMX5F_8c
- FACTS:
  - great midrange and treble
  - low(er) bass
  - recommended entry level audiophile pair from pretty much everyone

- hardware c: https://youtu.be/spktoWVAlTU
  - very comfortable
  - good mic
  - balanced sound
  - low(er) bass
- badseed: https://youtu.be/tn4CecrUU8Y
  - not a lot different compared to game one <--- ding ding ding
  - clamping force high on start, then they break in(hd58x is more stiff, with similiar clamping force)
  - won't cause cable noise unless you force it
  - scales well with dac amps, noticable difference, especially with bass
  - these are midfi
  - decent detail, good layering
  - mids are slightly recessed
  - hd58x is a breakthrough when upgraded from these pairs
  - hd58x is less comfortable and less durable
  - vs a higher end gsp, gsp is gonna have better audio quality but the long wear comfort is worse on those
  - vs something like hyperx clouds, this is better
  - vs CM mh751, mh is more comfortable, sound q depends on preference really, mh is a little bass light (NOT TO MENTION NOT OPEN BACK)
- z review: https://youtu.be/H_xCgvay1oU
  - i like these better than the 500 series, this is more comfortable, this has better sound q
  - balanced sound
  - same "family of driver" from hd 600
- FACTS:
  - based on game one
  - valure or whatever the fuk earpads and top
  - 250g
  - small flat loose volume wheel
  - counts as semi open
  - removable weird cable

## PC38x($275 MSRP: $170): :thumbsup:

- Z review: https://youtu.be/F5QKOR_CL3Y
  - they're so good
  - imaging = 58x
  - scales well with dac/amps
- Badseed(sep 2020) https://youtu.be/FndDPg7Ei0k
  - hd58x is pretty close when upgraded from these pairs sound quality wise
  - bass is great, mids are servicable(classic neutral sennheiser), highs are punchy, thats what u want in a gaming headset
  - detail and seperation are great compared to hd 58x, very comparable
  - hd58x arguably delivers the more balanced experience, objectively offers more detail retrieval on the high end
  - damn good for gaming
- hardware c: https://youtu.be/zNjO98dZUGQ
  - very comfortable, waaay more than gsp 500, 600
  - good mic
  - drivers are same as gsp 500 and 600, way better than 37x(which z review already said good to). Way more bass
  - 37x has less rich low end, sharper high end, hence 37x is brighter, 38x is a bit more mellow (wtf am i typing at this point)
- DMS https://youtu.be/RufnLmBWTJw:
  - comfortable
  - doesn't benefit much from an amp unless ur computer has bad motherboard
  - imaging is amazing
  - music detail is worse than 6xx but that's setting the bar high
  - highly recommends as one of the best for gaming
- FACTS:
  - new pad pairs are included, sports mesh material(inside earcups is still velor)
  - 2 different cables: split long and combined 3.5mm 1.5m
  - removable weird cable
  - small flat loose volume wheel

## ATH-AD700X($210 MSRP: $200 2013) + modmic($80-$300) = $290 min :thumbsdown:

- hc - https://youtu.be/oJeRWOLJ_hg
  - headband is loose and not robust (exactly my words on first glance lol)
- FACTS:
  - 265g
  - headbands look really uncomfortable and flimsy imo
  - watching hc's video that looks VERY uncomfortable

## AD900X($308) + modmic($80-$300) :thumbsdown:

- way too expensive for babies first open back

## [Philips Fidelio X2HR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDOmG1O5ZlQ)($207, MSRP:$150) + boompro ($60) :thumbsup:

- badseed(sep 19): https://youtu.be/yDOmG1O5ZlQ
  - vs x2 there are minor revisions here, mostly for the better, sound q is identical
  - gibson produced some of these headphones, on those pairs the earpads are glued on, avoid
  - overbuilt truck
  - steel headband covered in real leather
  - inside, self adjusting very breathable mesh pad
  - big, pretty comfortable, 4h with minor discomfort
  - these cans leak just enough for the mic to pick it up
  - pads are circular memory foam covered with velure like k7xx, 55m inside
  - they do get a little warm(sept 2019)
  - sound: smooth, warm, buttery soft, highs which zip in from outer space and land right on your eardrum, vocals feel textured, they sparkle, nothing offensive here. Bass is low, round, tonal. If you like edm hiphop rnb , THIS IS IT at the price point
  - everything I liked about ship 9500 is here, but to a higher degree, more polished, more layered, cleaner version of that
  - these definitely benefit from external power, doesn't change the dynamics though.
  - in gaming these are very solid due to big ss
  - imaging is good but not on par with smth like hd58x because i feel like these lack the ability to layer the top end
  - i think there's better options out there for multiplayer fps specifically, k7xx or hd58x would be better for this specific task
  - id take these over 58x, subjective
  - vs he4xx its a tough call, love those for music, never recommend those for gaming. he4xx doesn't have as much air and sparkle in the vocals
  - you aren't going to hit another headphones that feels like a lvlup until the 500$ dt 1990 pros
- z review(nov 19): https://youtu.be/YAskyycUqVQ
  - best in class for $200
  - you can use these to analyse music
  - tube amp doesnt do much
  - they are visceral, attack you with sound, but its pleasurable (this contradicts with what badseed said)
- joshua valour https://youtu.be/ZcHxxCtxerg
  - this guy said memory foam makes good bass but traps HEAT (ARGH! NO!)
- FACTS:
  - 380g

## Philips Fidelio X3($415) + boompro ($60) :thumbsdown:

- bad seed: https://youtu.be/KCTsKfk8Ys8
  - very close to x2hr but better, x2 more expensive, not really comfortable for short term/long term
- z review: https://youtu.be/Q-_oqjJlSHo
- FACTS:
  - low value bundle compared to anything else

## Drop x AKG K7XX($265, MSRP: $200, 2015) + modmic($80-$300) :thumbsup:

- z review https://youtu.be/1TCRlKktr_4
  - these are comfortable
  - "prob my fav sounding headphones Q2 2015"
- bad seed https://youtu.be/KVhHgKKKc9w
  - "best soundstage for gaming Q2 2019 hands down among all headphones"
  - prefers this over HD 58X wtf
  - doesn't feel durable
  - top and bottom of ears may make conctact with pads
  - low clamping force
  - super comfortable
  - u dont need a discrete amp but i highly recommend one here
  - sound stage is great, its big
  - vs 58x mids are same, highs are slightly too harsh, intense on 58x but with beautiful detail and extension, k7xx has a bit more air on the highs where 58x has more detail, k7xx has a solid warm low end
  - vs dt990 I don't like the character of highs on dt990 vs k7xx and dt990 lacks the warmth 
  - no bass boost needed, its tuned great already
  - k7xx chill relaxed, spacial headphone. hd58x is more energetic, nuanced, intimate headphone
  - for music my nod goes to 58x
  - sound stage makes for great gaming, imaging is great, hd58x falls short vs this guy
  - its so perfectly balanced
  - vs dt 990 the only place 990 wins is the brightness on the high end, k7xx is just a better experience for gaming
  - like 58x, it doesn't need an amp
- mkbhd https://youtu.be/WmhKCq0vfjE
- hardware canucks https://youtu.be/R4VKdn5ctLY
  - comfort is amazing
- FACTS:
  - Drop version of AKG K702 65th anniversary edition(MSRP: $499)
  - 230g
  - black valure dense memory foam pads (these pads normally cost $90)
  - weird cable
  - great pair, is a little too expensive for me, I'd buy the 38x instead, more convenient, less cables

## Beyerdynamic 459038 DT 990 PRO ($240, MSRP:$350, 2014) + modmic($80-$300) :thumbsup:

- hc https://youtu.be/xg8qQkGD2Cs
  - surpasses hd650's for comfort, very comfortable
  - sound sig is very spesific, could be fatigueing for some ears
  - mids are recessed
  - clean treble, tight bass extension
- DMS https://youtu.be/Ls0Dpo_mS4w
  - you'll either love the sound sig or hate it, you have to test them before you get them
  - after a while comfort wanes off because of the top
  - not particularly strong lows
  - not a lot of bass extension
  - VERY bright, increase in treble, piercing, good for analytical applications
  - instrument seperation is phenomenal
- FACTS:
  - semi open
  - low clamping
  - there are newer, better, cheaper alternatives 
  - 2 versions, 80 and 250 ohm. 250 doesn't work well with phones

## Hifiman Massdrop HE4xx($180 on drop => ~$270 with tax and shipping)  + modmic($80-$300) â+â âamâpâ?:thumbsup:

- badseed: https://youtu.be/PNm8CSMnkSM
  - "my new fav open back Q1 2019"
  - big and heavy compared to sennheiser and akg
  - velour contact pads and leather on the outside. Angled pads, thinner on the front
  - low clamping force
  - very open back
  - easier than 6xx to run on phones, this outshines 6xx by far on phones
  - recommends discrete amp
  - very unique sound signature, might not be for everyone
  - highs are detailed but not emphasised, they have a great amount of sparkle to them, they push back a bit in a mix, not shouting at you which i like, very smooth
  - low end is definitely there as well
  - mids don't feel like they have to fight against lows or the highs, it's like everything has its own spot in a mix so overall very balanced, cohesive
  - vocal, harmonizing vocals are perfectly layered
  - everything feels very wide and very warm
  - planar magnetics give good low end anyway 
  - hd58x highs and 6xx lows, best of both worlds, are here.
  - burn these in, pink noise 24h 60db
  - "ive been able to pick cues up vertically in gaming with these" woah there cowboy
  - imaging no problem
  - sound stage is wide, wider than 58x, way wider than 6xx, on par with dt990, not nearly as wide as the k7xx
  - no treble focus makes this headphones lose #1 for fps gaming, gaming requires a treble forward sig, not gonna be bright as a 6xx, not nearly as bright as a dt990
  - at 180$ for general gaming and music, id take these over every other open back headphones
  - early batches had QC issues
- z review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmXfV1HIcmM
- DMS https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xg2wUXDvwM
- FACTS:
  - planar magnetic headphones
  - 400g
  - 2expensive4me

## HD 560

- ephemeral device, only 1 image and nothing else about it exists on the internet, kinda sus

## HD 560S($220 ) + modmic($80-$300) :thumbsup:

- badseed https://youtu.be/RMYFu8SKA7Y
  - better ss than hd58x and 6xx
  - flat neutral, if u want low end punch though, no dice, worse bass than 58x or 6xx
  - 38x had v shape eq, for high end its a lot like what i like on the 560s but it brings bass to the table aswell and it does it without sounding too dark as well, 38x doesn't stand out detail retrieval wise compared to 560s or 6xx especially at high volume 
  - overall reminds me of sundara
- RMS https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np6KjAAT98A
  - comfortable
  - the most neutral headphones ive ever heard (q4 2020)
  - better ss than 6xx 660s, worse than 700 800, similiar to pc37x
  - imaging on par with hd598, ballpark with 660s
  - greater detail than 6xx 650 660s
  - THE reference headphone for analytical and critical listening
  - really like it
  - this is the sennheiser flagship for me
  - using a90 and d90 to power it

  - scales well
- FACTS:
  - 559 is better for the price

## [HD 599](https://www.hepsiburada.com/sennheiser-hd-599-kulak-cevreleyen-high-end-kulaklik-p-HBV000003GAOG?magaza=nidaelektronik) ($220) + modmic($80-$300)  :thumbsdown: :thumbsup:

- z review: Hd 500 series https://youtu.be/FMgmV33fPG0
  - small sountstage
  - unforgiving amount of detail, like m50, or 598, sound shoves so hard into your ears, any fuckup in the recording will fuck you up too
  - doesn't scale well with amps and dacs except tube amps
  - 
- FACTS:
  - more research needed, but this combo is more expensive than 38x for me so im skipping
