# Thmyris' Purchasing Guides For Everyday Items
I do extreme due diligence whenever I want to purchase anything. Surpassing the knowledge of most if not all in-depth reviewers you can find on the internet. Most of my work ends up as notes in a markdown file, never to be seen by anyone else forever. This is my way of sharing them with the world. They're janky and so is this method of sharing. If they manage to save you some amount of time, I am happy.
